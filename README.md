# PokeFlashCards
Competitive pokemon (VGC 2022) flash cards for personal use

## Description

This is a simple web application that pulls data from `pokeapi` and tests the users knowledge on the stats
of each pokemon. This is meant to be a tool for vgc players and smogon players. You will be given a random gen 1 pokemon (for now
until I put in time to expand it to all gens) and have to rearrange their stats in the right order. Use your mouse to click and drag the stats, and once you get them all in the right place, the app should moe on to the next pokemon
